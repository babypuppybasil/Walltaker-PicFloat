# Walltaker-PicFloat

THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL SCRIPT and is no means endorsed by any official moderation/administration of Walltaker. Please support
the hard work of the original creators, and the people that work hard to maintain the site and Discord. 

**WHAT DOES THIS DO?**
-Asks for an ID code (your 5 digit code made on the official site)
-Calls ID to the Walltaker API
-Displays the images on the window very slowly moving, as if photos laid down like a slideshow, overlaying each other.
-Screensaver-like functionality. Sit back and enjoy the gently floating pictures that change every time when a new picture comes in! (15 second checks!) 


**In Honor To Greeeeey's Request**

**Improvements in the future**
    1) multiple ids
    2) click and drag
    3) ability to lock in an id (Thank you _3ther_!) 
    4) make new image front and center then maybe drift off to the sides
    5) constrain images to the window
    6) Special credits link for those who tested/helped!
