**WHAT DOES THIS DO?**
-  Asks for an ID code (your 5 digit code made on the official site)
-  Calls ID to the Walltaker API
-  Displays the images on the window very slowly moving, as if photos laid down like a slideshow, overlaying each other.
-  Screensaver-like functionality. Sit back and enjoy the gently floating pictures that change every time when a new picture comes in! (15 second checks!)
