Note 1) -Blaze The Drenched Dragon - Concern for safety of script running
Note 2) Blaze The Drenched Dragon - Did not know how to open file. Fix with tutorial (Thanks _3ther_)

Suggestion 1) _3ther_ suggested putting it main page on firefox through settings to make it like a homepage. 

IMPROVEMENT 1) Blaze The Drenched Dragon: Would like to have ID to not have to be typed on every reload: Persistant ID code.

NEW BUILD 1) _3ther_ creates persistant ID to assist Blaze the Drenched Dragon on Improvement 1.

Positive 1) "Fun xP looks cute but needs some improving"  

IMPROVEMENT 2) Blaze the Drenched Dragon: i think you should be able to click and drag honestly if you can use the api stuff so i can respond to the new images i might use this as my default
but heres some posible feature requests  multiple ids click and drag ability to lock in an id make new image front and center then maybe drift off to the sides  constrain images to the window

Bug 1) Discovered by _3ther_ for me, it puts everything in to the same spots over and over againa <<Needs some variety and more angles>>

Positive 2) Blaze the Drenched Dragon: i will say the speed they are moving is perfect

Bug 2) Discovered by Blaze The Drenched Dragon: - Photo seems to show, all images are showing really straight, and overloading the screen way to much. Suggested to bring to 15.
